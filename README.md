# Python SDK for Rumo

This is the first attempt at a public SDK for Rumo.

See official Rumo API documentation [here](https://apidoc.rumo.co/)

## Importing the repository

### From github

To install directly from the remote github repository:

`pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/Spideo/rumo-sdk-python.git`

This can also be adapted in a `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` file.

### Locally

To install instead from your local directory, use:

`pip install -e {PATH_TO_LOCAL_DIR}`.

This corresponds to an [editable install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs),
useful when you are both using and developing the library at the same time.
